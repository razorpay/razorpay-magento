- In the Assign Order Status to State section,
   - From the existing list of the order status, select the Order Status to assign.
   - Choose the Order State to include the order status youâ€™ve just assigned. **Use Order state as `processing`**
    - Accept the order status as a default status, tick the Use Order Status as Default checkbox.
    - Enable the order status on the storefront, please tick the Visible On Storefront checkbox.
 - Click on ` Save Status Assignment` to complete.

### Step 4: Using Custom order status for Razorpay Magento

- At field `Custom Paid Order Status` select `Yes` to enable custom order status, select `No` to disable custom order status.
